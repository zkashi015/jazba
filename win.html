			<h2>WHY WE CHOSE WIN</h2>
			<div class="image fox"></div>
			<p class="paragraph">Inspired by the 2012 Delhi gang rape case, Jazba Entertainment has partnered with the non-profit organization, Women In Need, to help further their cause. We use the competition as a platform to raise both awareness and funds for WIN.
			<br><br>Women In Need has been operating in Nagpur, India since August 2000. Their organizational mission is simple - to rehabilitate the lives of impoverished women in India.

			<h2>MEET THE WIN TEAM</h2>
			<div class="image wolf"></div>
			<p class="paragraph">We often wonder what it must be like to experience discrimination, abuse, rape, terminal illness, confusion, fear, and pain, and to do so without the comfort of another person being there to lend a helping hand, offer a solution, or simply provide a sympathetic ear. It is a question that constantly bothers us as we meet so many ladies in Nagpur through Women In Need."
