			<h2>OUR INSPIRATION</h2>
			<div class="image fox"></div>
			<p class="paragraph">Inspired by the 2012 Delhi gang rape case, Jazba Entertainment has partnered with the non-profit organization, Women In Need (WIN)--an organization that rehabilitates the lives of impoverished South Asian women who suffer or have suffered from sexual assault, HIV/AIDS, leprosy, and the pitfalls of poverty.
			<br> <br> Through hosting a variety of fundraising and non-fundraising events throughout the year, Jazba Entertainment supports WIN and raises awareness for South Asian women empowerment and South Asian culture in the Twin Cities community.
